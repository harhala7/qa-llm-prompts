MODE=EXECUTE

Bug report:
After the latest deployment, users report that submitting the checkout form sometimes fails with a generic error message.
The page reloads and the order is not created.

Expected behavior:
The order should be created and the user should be redirected to the confirmation page.

Actual behavior:
The page reloads, shows a generic "Something went wrong" message, and no order is created.

Environment:
- Production
- Web application (frontend + backend)
- Affects logged-in users

Frequency / reproducibility:
- Intermittent
- Reported by multiple users within the last hour

Additional context:
- Deployment completed ~30 minutes before first reports
- No clear error message shown to users
- Customer support reports increased contact volume
